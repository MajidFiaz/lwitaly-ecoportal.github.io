# Virtualization Environments

OntoPortal OVF works in virtualization environments such as 
VMware and VirtualBox. It may also work with KVM, but this has not been tested with {{site.opva_version}}.
Brief instructions for each of these are provided below.

## VMware
You can import OVA Template from previously downloaded ova file or you can import it directly from the URL into your VMware product. 

## VirtualBox
VirtualBox supports importing OVA images directly. 
Simply start your VirtualBox software, 
then select File->Import Appliance and select the OVA file included in the Ontoportal Virtual Appliance download.
